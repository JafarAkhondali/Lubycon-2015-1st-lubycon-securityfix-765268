###LUBYCON
Hi guys. This is Dart.
You can modify this page free. what i'm going to say if you have any ideas plz add list on this page.

I think we better determine some rules for LUBYCON.

###for example 
* file Directory
* structure for Web Database
* The date that When we meet
  (bcuz if I and Ssaru are starting term at school maybe we should change day that we meet I think)
* When we better have english time...etc


###The syntax for readme page
* '#'Title'#'
* '###'ul
* '*'li(if you want use li that you must use ul first)
