###LUBYCON###
Hi guys. This is Dart. 
I think we better determine some rules for LUBYCON.
for example, 
* file Directory
* structure for Web Database
* The date that When we meet
  (bcuz if I and Ssaru are starting term at school maybe we should change day that we meet I think)
* When we better have english time...etc


Whatever you can modify this page free. what i'm going to say if you have any ideas plz add list on this page.

The syntax for readme page 
* '#'Title'#'
* '###'ul'###'
* '*'li
